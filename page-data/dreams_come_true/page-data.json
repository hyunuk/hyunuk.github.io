Long story short, I applied and received a permanent residency of Canada, traveled around the world, immigrated to Canada, and changed my whole career.</p>\n<p>When I accepted to the UBC, I set my goal to “join Google”.\nWhy Google? I thought they are the best company, and if I study really hard with some luck and talent, then I might get there. Even if I failed though I tried, my effort will never betray me and it will make me a better developer.</p>\n<p>I applied for internships to 100+ companies every year after I entered UBC in 2018. I can remember my first interview, which I completely ruined after not sleeping nor eating from the night before.</p>\n<p>From then on, the company that I applied for each every six months, that didn’t let me pass even a single resume review stage til I’ve done three internships and solved 480+ Leetcode problems, eventually opened the door and accepted me.</p>\n<p>This summer, I am going to start working as a developer relations intern at Google NYC! Thank you so much to everyone helped me.</p>","categories":["Diary"],"date":"May 08, 2022","description":"Dreams Come True","id":"a36e14de-6649-5675-80bb-c32e1de12dd9","keywords":["Google","Internship"],"slug":"/dreams_come_true/","title":"Dreams Come True","readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}},"listingPagePath":"/blog"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1094019748","460736852"],"slicesMap":{}}
